# File system path

- There are two path to navigate to the file system.

1. `Absolute Path: ` An absolute path always begins with `/`. This indicates that the path start at the root directory. An example of an absolute path is
   `cd /var/log`

This points directly to the file no matter where you're currently located.

2. `Relative Path:` A relative path does not begin with a `/`. It identifies a location relative to your current position. An example of relative path is `cd /var` `cd /log`
